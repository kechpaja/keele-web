 - Questions

What other games should we have? I have an idea for one other: select the
correct picture given a word, possibly with a time limit. This could also be
arranged as a waterfall. 

Perhaps a game where the user has to identify a word from the audio only. One
where they have to type, and another where they have to select a picture.
