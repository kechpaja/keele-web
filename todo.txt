Do we want to be fetching each part of a lesson in that part, or should we
fetch everything at once and pass JSON objects to the init functions? 

For now, we're doing the former, although grammar may end up being the latter.
I'm probably in favor of the latter in the long run. 



Consider factoring the waterfall game out into a separate page, which just
takes a url parameter to load its data from.


I did that. For the time being, the URLs will look a bit ugly, but they will
function. Eventually we will replace most of these pages with RESTful
endpoints that are prettier, so don't worry about it right now.
